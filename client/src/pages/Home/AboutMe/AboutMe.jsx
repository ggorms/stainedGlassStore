        I have always considered myself to be a creative person but I could not
        find an art form that would satisfy me for very long. That was until I
        took a stained glass class in high school. I was immediately drawn into
        being able to create something more tangible than a drawing or painting.
        I could create whatever I wanted, and hold in my hand in a way that no
        other medium had been able to.

        At first, I made 2D mosaics that, while still beautiful, began to feel
        plain and quite frankly, boring. That&#39;s when I started experimenting
        with making my pieces 3D. The first 3D peice I made was a makeup box for
        my mother, the next a robot who&#39;s arms could move. Shortly after
        this, I graduated high school and I knew I had to continue my passion,
        so I bought everything I needed to make stained glass peices at home.

        Over the years my stained glass skills have improved tremendously - as
        has my ambition in terms of what projects I take on. I now primarily
        focus on creating real world objects in stained glass form, as well as
        functional peices - such as trays and boxes. What began as a hobby
        transistioned into a way to make sentimental gifts for my friends and
        family. I am now looking to share my passion with the masses and sell or
        create peices for all who see the beauty in my work!
